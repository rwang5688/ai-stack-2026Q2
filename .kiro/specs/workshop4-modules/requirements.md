# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating reusable workshop materials for Workshop 4 Modules 1-6, focusing on foundational Agentic AI concepts with Strands Agents SDK. The workshop modules provide progressive hands-on experience building from basic MCP tools to complex agent interactions, preparing students for advanced multi-agent implementations.

## Glossary

- **Strands Agents SDK**: Software development kit for building agentic AI applications
- **Workshop System**: The complete educational platform including materials, code examples, and infrastructure for modules 1-6
- **MCP Tool**: Model Context Protocol tool for AI agent integration
- **Workshop Materials**: Educational content including documentation, code examples, and exercises for foundational concepts
- **Agent Framework**: Core framework for single and multi-agent interactions using Strands SDK
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Support for both Linux and Windows (via Git Bash) development environments

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workshop instructor, I want comprehensive workshop materials for foundational Agentic AI concepts with Strands Agents SDK (Modules 1-6), so that I can deliver effective progressive training to students.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workshop materials are accessed THEN the Workshop System SHALL provide complete documentation for Strands Agents SDK foundational concepts
2. WHEN students follow the module progression THEN the Workshop System SHALL enable successful implementation from basic MCP tools to complex agent interactions
3. WHEN instructors prepare for delivery THEN the Workshop System SHALL include all necessary setup instructions and prerequisites for modules 1-6
4. WHEN workshop content is updated THEN the Workshop System SHALL maintain consistency across all module materials and code examples
5. WHERE cross-platform compatibility is required THEN the Workshop System SHALL support both Linux and Windows (Git Bash) environments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to progress through foundational agent concepts (Modules 1-6), so that I can build understanding from basic tools to complex agent interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing Module 1 THEN the Workshop System SHALL demonstrate basic MCP calculator tool creation and usage
2. WHEN completing Module 2 THEN the Workshop System SHALL show weather agent implementation with external API integration
3. WHEN completing Module 3 THEN the Workshop System SHALL provide knowledge base agent with document retrieval capabilities
4. WHEN completing Module 4 THEN the Workshop System SHALL demonstrate agent workflow orchestration patterns
5. WHEN completing Module 5 THEN the Workshop System SHALL show memory agent implementation with persistent state management
6. WHEN completing Module 6 THEN the Workshop System SHALL demonstrate meta-tooling agent with dynamic tool creation capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want hands-on exercises with progressive complexity, so that I can build practical skills with agentic AI development step by step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing exercises THEN the Workshop System SHALL provide interactive coding challenges with immediate feedback for each module
2. WHEN building MCP tools THEN the Workshop System SHALL guide students through tool creation and integration processes
3. WHEN testing agent interactions THEN the Workshop System SHALL enable validation of agent functionality at each module level
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the Workshop System SHALL provide comprehensive logging and troubleshooting guidance
5. WHERE advanced features are explored THEN the Workshop System SHALL offer optional extension exercises within each module scope

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want reusable and modular workshop components for foundational concepts, so that I can adapt the materials for different audiences and build toward advanced implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customizing content THEN the Workshop System SHALL support modular workshop component selection for modules 1-6
2. WHEN adapting for audiences THEN the Workshop System SHALL provide configurable difficulty levels within foundational scope
3. WHEN reusing materials THEN the Workshop System SHALL maintain clear separation between foundational concepts and advanced implementations
4. WHEN updating components THEN the Workshop System SHALL ensure backward compatibility with existing module deployments
5. WHERE integration is required THEN the Workshop System SHALL provide clear foundation for advanced multi-agent workshop extensions

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.\n\n### Response 1:\nWe observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections.\n\n### Response 2:\nLabel: Discrete interpretation of continuous prompts.\n\n### Evaluation:\n"}],"ability":"pairwise-judging","reward_model":{"style":"llmj","ground_truth":"2\n\n### Reason: Response 2 correctly identifies the main topic of the abstract and provides an appropriate label.\n\n### Reference: Discrete interpretation of continuous prompts."},"extra_info":{"split":"train","index":82,"raw_output_sequence":"2\n\n### Reason: Response 2 correctly identifies the main topic of the abstract and provides an appropriate label.\n\n### Reference: Discrete interpretation of continuous prompts.\n","llmj":{"question":"Below are two responses for a given task.

This is largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a devastating impact on the American economy. Many businesses have been forced to close due to the pandemic, leading to a decrease in consumer spending and a decrease in overall economic activity. In addition, the stock market has seen a significant decline in value, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropping more than 20% since the start of the year.\n\n### Response 2:\nThe economic situation in the U.S. has changed drastically in the last few years due to a combination of factors, including the effects of the 2008 financial crisis, the Great Recession, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate has risen significantly, and many businesses have been forced to close their doors due to the economic downturn.

One day, Tom and Jerry decided to take a break from their usual antics and go on an adventure together. They traveled to a faraway land, where they encountered many strange and exciting creatures. Along the way, they learned valuable lessons about friendship and teamwork. In the end, Tom and Jerry returned home with a newfound appreciation for each other.\n\n### Response 2:\nOnce upon a time, there was a young boy named Tom who lived in a small village. One day, he decided to explore the nearby forest, and he stumbled upon a mysterious cave. Inside the cave, he found a strange creature that he had never seen before. \n\nThe creature was friendly and seemed to understand Tom's language, so the boy decided to stay and explore the cave with the creature. After a few hours of talking, the creature revealed that the cave was actually a portal to another world. \n\nTom and the creature journeyed through the portal, and eventually they arrived in the new world. Tom was amazed by the beauty of the new world, and he decided to stay and explore it further. \n\nOne day, while exploring the new world, Tom and the creature came across a large lake. They decided to take a boat and explore the lake together. As they sailed across the lake, they encountered many strange creatures, some of which were friendly and some of which were hostile. \n\nEventually, Tom and the creature made it back to the village, and Tom was able to tell his story to the villagers. The villagers were amazed by Tom's adventure, and they thanked him for bringing them to the new world.\n\n### Evaluation:\n","ground_truth":"1\n\n### Reason: Response 1 is better because it follows the instruction and includes both Tom and Jerry as the main characters, while Response 2 creates a new story that does not involve Jerry.\n\n### Reference: Once upon a time, there were two mischievous characters named Tom and Jerry.

For example, a person could create a situation in which they believe that they have already achieved a certain result, such as a job interview or a promotion. This could be done by creating a situation in which the person believes that they have already achieved the desired outcome, such as a job interview or a promotion.

This could be done by creating a situation in which the person believes that they have already achieved the desired outcome, such as a job interview or a promotion.\n\n### Response 2:\nThe experiment would involve two groups of participants. The first group would be asked to make predictions about the performance of the second group. The second group would be asked to make predictions about the performance of the first group. The predictions made by the first group would be compared to the actual performance of the second group, and the predictions made by the second group would be compared to the actual performance of the first group.

The oxygen is then released into the atmosphere, while the glucose is stored in the plant's cells.\n\n### Response 2:\nPhotosynthesis is a process by which plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose.

She was mesmerized by the creature's beauty and power, and she knew she had to find a way to befriend it. \n\nSarah bravely approached the dragon and spoke to it in a gentle voice. The dragon was intrigued by Sarah's kindness and curiosity, and soon the two of them became the best of friends. \n\nFrom that day forward, Sarah and the dragon were inseparable. They explored the countryside together, learning about each other's cultures and customs. Sarah even taught the dragon how to read and write, and the dragon taught Sarah how to fly. \n\nSarah and the dragon remained close until the day Sarah had to leave the village. Before she left, Sarah gave the dragon a parting gift - a magical necklace that granted the dragon the ability to turn into a human at will. \n\nSar\n\n### Response 2:\nOnce upon a time, there was a young girl who lived in a small village in the countryside. One day, she decided to venture out into the world beyond the village and explore the world around her. As she ventured further and further away from home, she began to notice strange creatures in the distance. Curious, she followed them and soon found herself in the midst of a magical adventure.\n\n### Evaluation:\n","ground_truth":"1\n\n### Reason: Response 1 follows the instruction and provides a clear and engaging story with a magical creature as the protagonist's companion. Response 2 does not fully address the prompt as it does not include a magical creature encounter.\n\n### Reference: Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Jack who stumbled upon a magical unicorn while wandering in the forest. The unicorn took Jack on a magical journey through the forest, showing him all the wonders of nature. They became the best of friends and Jack visited the unicorn every day until he had to return home.","document_in_context":null},"sample_size":1980}}

Supply-side policies tend to increase economic growth in the short-term, while demand-side policies tend to increase economic growth in the long-term.\n\n### Evaluation:\n","ground_truth":"2\n\n### Reason: Response 2 provides a more detailed and accurate comparison and contrast of the economic consequences of supply-side and demand-side economic policies.\n\n### Reference: The economic consequences of supply-side and demand-side economic policies can be compared and contrasted. Supply-side policies focus on increasing the supply of goods and services in the economy, such as tax cuts and deregulation. Demand-side policies focus on increasing the demand for goods and services in the economy, such as government spending and subsidies. Supply-side policies tend to increase economic growth in the short-term, while demand-side policies tend to increase economic growth in the long-term. However, supply-side policies can also lead to income inequality and inflation, while demand-side policies can lead to budget deficits and higher taxes.","document_in_context":null},"sample_size":1980}}
